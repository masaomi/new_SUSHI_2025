"""Acceptance check for the chain runner. Exit code 0 only if every case passes.

A fake backend, not the real one, because the case that matters cannot be produced on
demand against a cluster: **a step fails for a non-transient reason and the next step is
never submitted.** That is exactly what `afterany` gets wrong in job_manager, so it is the
behaviour the runner exists to provide, and it needs a test that can force it.

The live run on fgcz-h-083 covers the happy path against real data. This covers the paths
a real run will not reach on demand.
