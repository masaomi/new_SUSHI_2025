"""The chain runner — plain code, one step at a time.

Design v0.3 §10 submitted a whole chain and let SLURM sequence it. That is not
implementable here, and not because of a preference. `job_manager` hardcodes `afterany`
(`scheduler.py:65`), and when a parent has *already* failed it attaches no dependency at
all (case 7 of `scripts/job_manager_contract/wait_branch_check.py`, expected value `''`).
So SLURM will start a child whose parent failed, reading an input directory that is
missing or half-written. **Nothing below relies on SLURM to stop a chain.**

No model is involved anywhere in this file. Per design decision D4 the trigger, the timer,
every state transition and the retry decision are ordinary code; a model may only word a
proposal, break a tie between recipes, and narrate QC.

One tick polls everything in flight and then submits everything newly ready, so an
interrupted run resumes from the store rather than from memory. Until 2026-09-11 a tick did
at most one thing; steps that do not depend on each other now go out together.
