"""Talk to the Omics-Studio REST API, and ask SLURM why a job died.

Why the REST API and not the `jobs` table: it is the single sanctioned door, it enforces
the token's project scope, it behaves identically on the test and production nodes, and it
needs no database credentials. On fgcz-h-082 direct database access is forbidden outright,
so a prototype that reads the table would have to be rewritten before it could ever move.

Why `sacct` as well: the REST API reports SUSHI's own status vocabulary
(CREATED / RUNNING / COMPLETED / FAILED / …), which says *that* a job failed. Only SLURM
says *why* — and `OUT_OF_MEMORY` is a state SLURM assigns itself, which is what lets the
retry rule be mechanical instead of a log heuristic.
